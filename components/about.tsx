          I'm a problem solver at heart who loves turning ideas into reality through code. As a Junior Software
          Developer, I thrive on creating efficient solutions that make a real difference. My passion lies in backend
          development, but I enjoy exploring the full spectrum of software engineering â€“ from crafting clean APIs to
          experimenting with AI. Constantly curious and always learning, I believe in writing code that not only works
          but tells a story. Let's collaborate and build something amazing together!
